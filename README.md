# Electron Gitlab CI Monitor

## Startup Instructions

1. `yarn install` from the root
1. `yarn run start`
1. In a new terminal window/tab, `yarn run electron`

## TODOs:

- [ ] Build the project more sensibly, should only need one task to run development. Probably requires ejecting CRA.

- [ ] Read projects/api/refresh rate configuration from a file

- [ ] URL encode a projects path instead of using project id

- [ ] Pretty up css and orient cards well
